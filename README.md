# Age-and-Gender-detection
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my face recognition CNN model project! This project uses a pre-trained CNN model to predict the age and gender of faces based on face data that includes age, gender, and ethnicity.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nipunarora8/age-gender-and-ethnicity-face-data-csv)

# Model
The face recognition CNN model is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras. The code for age and gender prediction is available in the notebook  The architecture of the models is as follows:
